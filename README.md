# BeirRun  
Beirrun is a fun 2-D drinking simulator which is being made for a Open Source Class at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute. The object of the game is to collect as many drinks as possible in a limited amount of time. However the more drinks you consume the more difficult it gets as controls and graphics distort.
